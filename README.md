Buenos Dias meu consagrado

The first thing you should know is:
- Yes, I use the image/name of an anime girl on my profile, if you're not mature enough to understand that not everyone likes to put their real name/photo on the internet, you're welcome to leave

Now, if you understand that and just think I'm a weirdo, and a virgin who only does certain things, if you understand me, for 2D girls, you're absolutely right, (well, almost ;P)

I don't have much to say here

So here I say goodbye

PS: the girl in the picture is from the manga/anime Jashin-Chan
